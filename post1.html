  <p>As a trusted mortgage lender in Atlanta, Success Mortgage Partners has helped countless homebuyers navigate the complexities of securing a home loan. One of the first steps is getting pre-approved, and many buyers have questions. Below we answer the most common ones so you know what to expect and how to get the best mortgage for your needs.</p>
  <h3>1. What Is a Mortgage Pre-Approval and Why Do I Need One?</h3>
  <p>A mortgage pre-approval is a written statement from a lender showing how much you may borrow based on your credit, income, debt, and assets. Why it matters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It gives you a clear price range for your home search.</li>
    <li>It shows agents and sellers you’re a serious buyer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. What Documents Do I Need?</h3>
  <p>Have these ready to speed up your pre-approval:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proof of income:</strong> pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements</li>
    <li><strong>Credit history:</strong> a recent credit report</li>
    <li><strong>Assets:</strong> savings, retirement, investment statements</li>
    <li><strong>Identification:</strong> government-issued ID and SSN</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. How Long Does It Take?</h3>
  <p>Usually a few hours to a couple of days, depending on how fast you provide documents and if any issues pop up.</p>
  <h3>4. Does Pre-Approval Guarantee the Loan?</h3>
  <p>No—pre-approval is based on initial info. Final approval still requires appraisal, inspection, and a fresh review of your finances.</p>
  <h3>5. How Can I Improve My Chances?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Check and boost your credit score</li>
    <li>Pay down existing debt</li>
    <li>Save for a larger down payment</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>6. How Long Is It Valid?</h3>
  <p>Typically 60–90 days. After that you may need to re-apply if you haven’t found a home.</p>
  <h3>7. Should I Shop Multiple Lenders?</h3>
  <p>It helps compare rates and fees, but do all credit checks within 30 days to limit score impact.</p>
