  <h2>Why Your Credit Score Matters Before Mortgage Pre-Approval</h2>
  <p>Welcome back! Today we’re diving into why having a solid credit score is crucial before you apply for a mortgage—and how a higher score can save you big money over time.</p>
  <h3>Why Credit Really Matters</h3>
  <p>Your credit score directly impacts the interest rate you’ll qualify for. Even a small bump in your score can lower your rate by 0.25% or more, translating into <strong>thousands of dollars in savings</strong> over a 30-year loan.</p>
  <h3>3 Steps to Improve Your Score Fast</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pay on time, every time:</strong> Late payments hurt your score the most. Set up autopay or calendar reminders.</li>
    <li><strong>Lower your balances:</strong> Aim to keep your credit-card utilization under 30% of each limit.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean up errors:</strong> Order a free credit report at annualcreditreport.com and dispute any inaccuracies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What to Watch Out For</h3>
  <p>Avoid opening too many new accounts at once—a flurry of credit inquiries can temporarily ding your score. Also, don’t close old accounts; length of history matters.</p>
  <p>By following these steps, you can often see a score increase within 60–90 days—just in time to submit your mortgage application with confidence.</p>
