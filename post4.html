    <h2>Top Ten Questions People Are Asking About Mortgages</h2>

    <h3>1. How much can I afford?</h3>
    <p>Affordability starts with calculating your debt-to-income ratio, which compares monthly debts (student loans, car payments, credit cards) to gross income. Most lenders prefer your total DTI‚Äîincluding the new mortgage‚Äîto stay below 43%. From there, factor in property taxes, insurance, and HOA fees to arrive at a comfortable monthly payment you can sustain.</p>

    <h3>2. What‚Äôs the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-qualification</strong> is a quick estimate based on self-reported income and debts‚Äîno hard credit pull, so it‚Äôs purely informational. <strong>Pre-approval</strong> is more authoritative: you submit pay stubs, W-2s, bank statements and authorize a credit check. You‚Äôll receive a conditional commitment letter stating the loan amount you qualify for, making your offer far stronger to sellers.</p>

    <h3>3. How much do I need for a down payment?</h3>
    <p>A 20% down payment on a conventional loan both lowers your monthly payment and avoids Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). But FHA loans allow as little as 3.5% down, USDA and VA loans can be 0% down for qualified borrowers, and many local first-time buyer programs offer down-payment assistance grants. The right option depends on your income, credit, and program eligibility.</p>

    <h3>4. What credit score do I need?</h3>
    <p>For a conventional loan, a minimum 620 credit score is typical; bump that above 680 and you‚Äôll access the best rates. FHA loans accept scores down to 580 with 3.5% down, and some programs may go even lower. Always pull your credit report early to correct errors and pay down revolving balances, as even a 20-point boost can lower your rate by 0.25% or more.</p>

    <h3>5. What interest rate can I expect?</h3>
    <p>Rates fluctuate daily based on the bond market and Fed policies. As of mid-2025, 30-year fixed rates are in the low to mid-6% range, but your personal rate depends on your credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and the specific loan program. Locking in your rate when it‚Äôs favorable can shield you from market swings while you shop for a home.</p>

    <h3>6. What loan types are available?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conventional:</strong> Fixed (30- or 15-year) or adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs).</li>
      <li><strong>FHA:</strong> Lower down-payment and credit requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>VA:</strong> No-down payment for qualified veterans or service members.</li>
      <li><strong>USDA:</strong> No-down payment for homes in eligible rural areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Jumbo:</strong> For properties above conforming loan limits, requires stronger credit and income documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-QM:</strong> Bank-statement loans and other flexible programs for self-employed borrowers who need alternative income documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. How much are closing costs?</h3>
    <p>Expect 2‚Äì5% of the purchase price in closing costs, covering lender fees (origination, underwriting), third-party fees (appraisal, title, recording), pre-paid items (taxes, insurance escrow), and any prepaid interest. You can negotiate seller concessions to cover a portion, roll certain costs into the loan, or shop around for the best service fees.</p>

    <h3>8. What is PMI and how do I avoid it?</h3>
    <p>Private Mortgage Insurance guards the lender if you default and is required when down payment is under 20% on conventional loans. You can avoid PMI by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Putting 20% down on a conventional loan.</li>
      <li>Opting for Lender-Paid Mortgage Insurance (higher rate but no monthly PMI).</li>
      <li>Using a piggy-back 80/10/10 combo loan (primary 80% + second 10% + 10% down).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. How does debt-to-income ratio work?</h3>
    <p>DTI is your recurring monthly debt divided by gross income. Front-end DTI covers housing costs only (usually &lt; 28%), back-end includes all debts (ideally &lt; 43%). Improving DTI can mean paying down balances, increasing income (bonuses, part-time work), or choosing a longer term to lower payments.</p>

    <h3>10. Are there first-time homebuyer programs?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Georgia Housing Finance Authority (GHFA) offers competitive rates and down-payment assistance up to 4% for qualified first-time buyers. Many counties (Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett) and cities supplement with local grant programs. Combine state and local aid to reduce out-of-pocket costs.</p>
